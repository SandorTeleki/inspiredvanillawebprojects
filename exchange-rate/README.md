## Exchange Rate

Select countries to get the exchange rate for a specific amount

## Project Specifications

- Display UI with 2 select lists for countries and 2 inputs for amounts
- Fetch exchange rates from API (https://api.exchangerate-api.com)
- Display the values for both countries
- Update values on amount change
- Swap country rates

## Changes:
- Refactor CSS to BEM style
- Minor CSS tweaks (added header navigation to return to main page, tweaked some colors, etc.)

## To Do:
- Check if input gets truncated at long numbers (maybe add commas or periods to make long numbers easier to see?)
- List out name of the selected currency below it. So EUR becomes Euro (so people know)
-
