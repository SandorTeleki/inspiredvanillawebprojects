Projects inspired by: https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects

Mini projects built with HTML5, CSS & JS. Each project was based on the projects linked above to which I tried to add my own spin. All the projects were gathered into this repository, and are hosted through GitHub pages as a quick hosting solution.
