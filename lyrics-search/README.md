## LyricsSearch App

Find songs, artists and lyrics using the [lyrics.ovh](https://lyrics.ovh) API

## Project Specifications

- Display UI with song/artist input
- Fetch songs/artists and put in DOM
- Add pagination
- Add get lyrics functionality and display in DOM

## Changes:
- Fully converted CSS to use BEM methodology
- Updated JS to user new BEM classes and not rely on stacking specificity
- Minor CSS tweaks (added header navigation to return to main page, tweaked some colors, etc.)

## To Do:
- Fix 'Get Lyrics' button CSS issue
- Have artist+song title change dynamically with screen size
- Fix API issues (next/previous doesn't work like it previously did)

## Note
Oringal API broke - no longer returns lyrics. Ditto for next/previous page functionality.
