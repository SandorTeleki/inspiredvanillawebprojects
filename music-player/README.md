## Music Player

Create beautiful UI to play music stored in the "music folder" using the HTML5 audio API

## Project Specifications

- Create UI for music player including spinning image and song detail popup
- Add play and pause functionality
- Switch songs
- Progress bar

## Changes:
- Fully converted CSS to use BEM methodology
- Added aria-label values to play/stop, previous/fast foward buttons for accessibility purposes
- Minor CSS tweaks (added header navigation to return to main page, tweaked some colors, changed screen width/height etc.)
- Play/Pause with space bar

## To Do:
- Shuffle button? (makes more sense if there are more songs)
- Drop down list of available songs?
